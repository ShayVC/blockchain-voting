# 🗳️ Blockchain Voting System

## 🎯 Purpose  
This repository contains a full-stack implementation guide for an **Ethereum-based voting application**, developed as a **course assignment**. It aims to demonstrate how blockchain can be integrated into real-world voting systems, focusing on transparency, decentralization, and security.

---

## 📌 High-Level Goals & Scope

✅ Voter registration (managed off-chain)  
✅ Candidate management (on-chain and off-chain)  
✅ Vote casting through Ethereum smart contracts  
✅ Real-time results directly from the blockchain  
✅ Modular codebase for **frontend, backend**, and **smart contracts**

🔗 Blockchain Architecture & Tech Stack
Layer	Tech Stack
Frontend	React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MetaMask Integration
Backend	Node.js, Express.js, RESTful API
Blockchain	Ethereum, Solidity, Truffle/Hardhat, Ganache
Database	MongoDB or PostgreSQL (for off-chain metadata only)
Dev Tools	VS Code, GitHub Actions, Mocha/Chai, MetaMask, Git CLI

🧱 Smart Contracts (Solidity)
✔️ Written in Solidity
✔️ Deployed to Ethereum (testnet or local Ganache)
✔️ Handles:

Candidate registration

Vote casting (one vote per verified address)

Real-time result tallying

Event logging for frontend updates

🛡️ Security Considerations
✅ Reentrancy protection

✅ Input validation (only registered voters can vote)

✅ Immutable vote storage (no deletions or overwrites)

🔙 Backend Integration (Node.js + Express)
📌 Acts as middleware between frontend and smart contracts
📌 Manages:

Voter registration

Candidate metadata (off-chain)

Auth & admin routes

🌐 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/registerVoter	Register a new voter
POST	/addCandidate	Admin adds a candidate
POST	/castVote	Send vote transaction to contract
GET	/results	Fetch real-time vote results
GET	/candidates	List all candidates
DELETE	/removeCandidate/:id	Remove a candidate (admin only)

🖥️ Frontend (React + MetaMask)
🔐 Wallet login (MetaMask)

🗳️ Cast vote (signed blockchain transaction)

📊 View live election results

🎯 Connect to backend & smart contract

🗃️ Database Schema (ERD Overview)
Used for off-chain management (not for storing votes).

Table	Fields
User	UserID, Name, Email, WalletAddress, Role (Voter/Admin)
Candidate	CandidateID, Name, Position, Party
Vote	VoteID, VoterID, CandidateID, Timestamp, TxHash
Election	ElectionID, Title, StartDate, EndDate

⚠️ Note: Votes are stored only on-chain for transparency and immutability. Off-chain data is used for metadata, user management, and audit logs.

🧪 Testing & CI/CD
✅ Unit tests for smart contracts using Mocha + Chai

✅ API tests with Postman / Jest

✅ GitHub Actions for:

Code linting

Build verification

Test automation
